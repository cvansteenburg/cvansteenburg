### Hi 👋 I'm Chase

I'm a founder currently working on [Hyperdrive](https://www.usehyperdrive.com). 

### Some of my other work includes:

* **[Briefly](https://www.getbrief.ing)**: Turn many emails into a single custom briefing. Only the topics you care about, delivered as often as you choose

* **[Landy](https://www.uselandy.com)**: The world's most user-friendly property management tool. Use natural language to add expenses, recognize income, and query data.

* **[LLMitless](https://github.com/cvansteenburg/LLMitless)**: API with endpoints for building and testing LLM chains

🧪 I'm especially interested in APIs and practical application of language models to solve business problems.<br>
🐍 I work mostly on the backend in Python and C, but also have experience (mostly breaking things) with various frontend technologies.<br>
💼 I have a lot of experience on the business side of startups [profile](linkedin.com/in/cvansteenburg). If you're a founder and want to talk, feel free to reach out!
